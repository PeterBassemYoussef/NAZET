  5. Online marketing and analysis<br>
  <br>
  Use of Google Analytics<br>
  We use the web analysis service Google Analytics from Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) on our website. The data processing serves the purpose of analyzing this website and its visitors. For this purpose, Google will use the information obtained on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other Google data. Google Analytics uses cookies that enable analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookies about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. IP anonymization is activated on this website. As a result, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google has certified itself according to the US-EU data protection agreement “Privacy Shield” and is therefore obliged to comply with European data protection guidelines. You can prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by downloading the browser plug-in available under the following link and install [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de].<br>
  <br>
  To prevent data collection and storage by Google Analytics across devices, you can set an opt-out cookie. Opt-out cookies prevent your data from being collected in the future when you visit this website. You must opt out on all systems and devices you use for this to be effective. If you delete the opt-out cookie, requests will be sent to Google again. If you click here, the opt-out cookie will be set: Deactivate Google Analytics.<br>

  <br>
  Further information about Google Remarketing and the associated data protection declaration can be found at: https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/<br>
  <br>
  Use of Google Ads conversion tracking<br>
  We use the online advertising program “Google Ads” on our website and, in this context, conversion tracking (visit action evaluation). Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland). If you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie for conversion tracking will be stored on your computer. These cookies have a limited validity, do not contain any personal data and are therefore not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to that page. Each Google Ads customer receives a different cookie. There is therefore no possibility that cookies can be tracked via the websites of Ads customers.<br>
  <br>
  The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics. Here we find out the total number of users who clicked on one of our ads and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. Your data may be transferred to the USA. Google has certified itself according to the US-EU data protection agreement “Privacy Shield” and is therefore obliged to comply with European data protection guidelines. You can deactivate personalized advertising for you in Google's advertising settings. Instructions can be found at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=de.<br>
  <br>
  Alternatively, you can prevent the use of cookies by third parties by accessing the Network Advertising Initiative deactivation page at https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and implementing the further opt-out information provided there.<br>
  <br>
  You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.<br>
  Further information and Google's privacy policy can be found at: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/<br>
  <br>
  Use of Facebook Remarketing<br>
  On our website we use the remarketing function “Custom Audiences” from Facebook and Instagram operated by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Dublin D02x525, Ireland). The purpose of the application is to target visitors to the website with interest-based advertising on the social networks Facebook and Instagram. For this purpose, the remarketing tag from Facebook and Instagram was implemented on the website. This tag creates a direct connection to the Facebook/Instagram servers when you visit the website. This sends information to the Facebook/Instagram server about which of our pages you have visited. Facebook/Instagram assigns this information to your personal Facebook/Instagram user account. When you visit the social network Facebook/Instagram, you will be shown personalized, interest-based Facebook/Instagram ads.<br>
  Your data may be transferred to Ireland. Facebook/Insagram or Meta has certified itself according to the US-EU data protection agreement “Privacy Shield” and is therefore obliged to comply with European data protection guidelines.<br>

  The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Under no circumstances will Google associate your IP address with other Google data.

  The data processing described below in this section, in particular the setting of cookies, is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR for our overriding legitimate interest:<br>
  <br>
  - on the needs-based and targeted design of the website, for example with analysis and statistical tools<br>
  - Target site visitors with interest-based advertising, for example with conversion tracking<br>
  - in measuring the success of partner advertising and the associated correct billing of commissions within the partner program<br>
  <br>
  For reasons arising from your particular situation, you have the right to object at any time to this processing of your personal data based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f of the GDPR.<br>
  <br>
  6. Newsletter Newsletter data<br>
  <br>
  If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the email address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. No further data is collected or only collected on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties. The data entered into the newsletter registration form is processed exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of data, the e-mail address and their use to send the newsletter at any time, for example via the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter.<br>
  <br>
  The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation. The data you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected.<br>
  <br>
  After you have been unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist by us or the newsletter service provider in order to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time.<br>
  <br>
  You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interests.",
